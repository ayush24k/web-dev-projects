        <h2>Berserk</h2>
        <P>Berserk (Japanese: ベルセルク, Hepburn: Beruseruku) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kentaro Miura. Set in a medieval Europe-inspired dark fantasy world, the story centers on the characters of Guts, a lone swordsman, and Griffith, the leader of a mercenary band called the "Band of the Hawk". Miura premiered a prototype of Berserk in 1988. The series began the following year in the Hakusensha's now-defunct magazine Monthly Animal House, which was replaced in 1992 by the semimonthly magazine Young Animal, where Berserk has continued its publication. Following Miura's death in May 2021, the final chapter that he wrote and illustrated was published posthumously in September of the same year; the series resumed in June 2022, under supervision of Miura's fellow manga artist and childhood friend Kouji Mori [ja] and Miura's group of assistants and apprentices from Studio Gaga.
        Berserk was adapted into a 25-episode anime television series by OLM, which covered the Golden Age story arc, and was broadcast from October 1997 to March 1998. The Golden Age arc was also adapted into a trilogy of theatrical anime films; the first two films premiered in 2012 and the third film premiered in 2013. A second 24-episode anime television series adaptation was broadcast for two seasons in 2016 and 2017.
        By October 2022, the Berserk manga had over 55 million copies in circulation, including digital versions, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. It received the Award for Excellence at the sixth installment of the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in 2002. Berserk has been widely acclaimed, particularly for its dark setting, storytelling, characters, and Miura's detailed artwork.</P>

        <h2>Guts Armour Story</h2>
        <P>At an unknown point in time, the Berserker Armor was forged by the dwarf blacksmith Hanarr, who imbued it with an ominous od that aligns with its wearer, who is driven by violent emotions and forgets about pain and fear. The armor was eventually donned by the man who became the Skull Knight, used by him to combat demonkind.Eventually, he entrusted the dangerous artifact to his friend, the witch Flora. In her care, it remained locked away.
        It is later entrusted to Guts after Flora's spirit tree mansion is invaded by apostles of Griffith's reborn Band of the Falcon. In spite of Grunbeld's immense strength, even after his fire dragon transformation, Guts easily withstands his attacks after donning the Berserker Armor and overwhelms the apostle in their clash.

        <h2>About Eclipse</h2>
        <P>Only those possessing the Crimson Beherit are able to trigger the Eclipse. Apostles eagerly anticipate the Eclipse, traveling to the designated site of the "promised time" in advance, and ominously awaiting the event at its predestined setting. After the Crimson Beherit is activated upon its owner reaching a point of profound despair, it creates a dimensional plane known as a "temporal junction point" in which the Eclipse takes place. The bearer of the Crimson Beherit is then presented the choice of offering as sacrifice what is most precious to them, in exchange for kinsmanship with the God Hand as a demon. The event's demonic conductor(s) play their part(s) in compelling the invoker so as to realize the invoker's pre-ordained decision. With the invoker's utterance of "I sacrifice," their rebirth as a God Hand member is initiated. Consequently, their sacrificial offerings are consecrated as such and left to the ravenous apostles present.
        As the feasting on the sacrifice(s) proceeds, the gestation of the newly conceived "child of darkness" undergoes. The invoker is overcome with a surge of sensations derived from the slaughter of their sacrifice(s) before they assume their proper form. After the invoker's rebirth is complete, the event is soon after brought to a close, unless the newborn Guardian Angel of Desire has other theatrics in-mind.</P>
